## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI** – A modern UI framework for building declarative user interfaces  
- **ARKit** – Enables augmented reality experiences, overlaying mission control center in the real world  
- **SceneKit** – Powers realistic 3D simulations of satellites and their orbital mechanics   
- **Charts** – Used to visualize various data from satellites during missions 
- **AVKit** – Supports video playback
